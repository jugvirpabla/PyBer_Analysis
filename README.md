# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
We have been asked by the CEO of PyBer, V. Isualize, to create an overall snapchat of revenue for a certain time (January - April, arranged by week) of the year varying by what city type the rides occurred in. The CEO would like the data presented to her in a line graph showing all the city types on the same chart with all the corresponding information.

## Resources
- Data Sources: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
- Software: Jupyter Notebooks, Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Statistics

## Summary
This is a breakdown of the data for the predetermined time frame. This shows how many rides, total drivers, and the averages for ride and how the driver made, sorted by the index of city types.

![Table1](https://github.com/jugvirpabla/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/analysis/Table1.png)

The Rural city type had the lowest number of total rides, drivers, and fares, but the averages are higher compared to the other city types. This could be the places are father apart in rural cities, thus creating farther rider distances and more time spend in those rides. The Urban city types had the highest amount of total ride, drivers, and fares. This could be because the Urban areas have a igher population, and places are closer together. This could provide more rides for the customers, and that demand also causes the abundance of more drivers. The averages are less, according the chart, but the overall revenue for the company and the driver could be more than the Rural and Suburban city types.

This the chart the CEO asked us to make. It reflects the same data as presented above, but by a week by week basis breakdown. 
There was spike of activity the week right before the start of March in every city type. This could be due to vacations, a city-event, or sporting event. This should be looked into, so that we could capitalize on future events for high profits. 

It is determined that everything increases in the Urban city type compared to the other two city types
